# Starter-Discord-Bot
This Bot is a bot for starters coded in discord.py! This will show you how python works or what you can do with coding. I made this mainly for beginners to get a very simple bot so you can start to understand the language. For more help, you can join my support discord server.


To start, Make sure you have python installed. 
Next extract the bot files onto your desktop (It will make it easier)
Make sure you have a discord bot application set up and copy the token. You can find this at - https://discord.com/developers/applications (DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN)
Next you can open the `main.py` file with Visual Studio, Notepad ++ or even notepad. I suggest Visual Studio Code. You can download this at - https://code.visualstudio.com/

When you open the `main.py` file, You will notice a lot of imports and code you may not know what any of it means. In order for your bot to work open your Command Prompt from clicking to the right of the file name `starter-bot-zane` and type `cmd`. This will open a command prompt for you. Then type `pip3 install discord` and go down the line of imports given in the code. 

Once you have finished copying your bots token found on the Discord Developer portal, open the code and go to the very bottom of the code in `main.py`.
You will see `bot.run("token")` - Replace "token" with your bot token. (ONCE AGAIN DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN)

Go back to your command prompt after pasting your token in and to start the bot do `py main.py` This will launch the bot. If the console tells you that you need to install something do `pip3 install (what you need to install)`. Everything you need to run the bot is imported at the very top (ex. `import asyncio`)

If you did everything right you have successfully started my beginner discord bot! You will know if you did everything correct if you get a message in the console saying "Bot Is Online"

Go invite your discord bot application to your discord server you want to test the bot in. It should be online and have a status saying "Playing Games with friends!"

After inviting the bot into your discord, You can now try a command! Try `!info` Or `!help`! 

CONGRATS! YOU NOW HAVE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL BOT! You can use this code to help you understand the language or you can add what ever you want to test new things you learn!

Thank you for deciding to use my discord bot coded in Python! If you have any further questions join my Discord discord.gg/SPb5gEMtpx
You may also join the main discord.py server for more support! https://discord.gg/dpy

The Bots code has everything walked through to make it easy to understand.
